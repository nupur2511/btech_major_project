# btech_major_project
This is a crime prediction project also the user will be able to receive contact information and adresses if the require help that is related to a particular crime.
To make this project work...we made 2 separate folders...in one folder created another folder in it naming it as template add the prediction.html and other html files to the template folder. Added the app.py,dataset,ipynb,Procfile(isn't required if you are using localhost),requirements file to the main folder...created another folder named model and add rf_model to it.
Added all the remaining files to the another folder that was created in the start.
To host the prediction part of the project we have used flask, created an evironment, activated it, after this add the path of the folder that contails all the required files and then put the command python app.py in the anaconda prompt. After which you will recieve a url..copy it and then paste it in your browser.
And to run the php part we have used the xampp server.
